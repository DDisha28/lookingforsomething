Website for a Business Listing Service 

## The idea:

The idea with this project is to have a listing of service information that can be searched via:

*Phase 1:*

- Category
- Region: Suburb/City etc
- Service Type
- Keywords
- etc

*Phase 2:*

Then I would like to get the website indexed by Google, so that any of the published listings can be available on Google when searched. 

*Phase 3:*

Later on, I would like to link this up with Google to get reviews / ratings etc.

## Interested

- Business Name

- Website
